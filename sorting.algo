1. Create an empty list (let's call it result) to store the distinct elements.

2. Start with the first list of numbers (Set 1).
    For each number in Set 1, check if it's already in the result list.
    If it's not in result, add it to the list.

3. Now, move to the second list of numbers (Set 2).
    For each number in Set 2, check if it's already in the result list.
    If it's not in result, add it to the list.
4. Finally, add up all the numbers in the result list. 
    This sum will be the answer to the problem, and it will include all the
    distinct numbers that appeared in either Set 1 or Set 2.
