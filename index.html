1. Create an empty array (let's call it result) to store the distinct elements.

    2. Start with the first list of numbers (Set 1).
        For each number in Set 1, check if it's already in the result array.
        If it's not in result, add it to the array.
    3. Now, move to the second list of numbers (Set 2).
        For each number in Set 2, check if it's already in the result array.
        If it's not in result, add it to the array.
    4. Finally, add up all the numbers in the result array. 
        This sum will be the answer to the problem, and it will include all the distinct 
        numbers that appear in either of the original sets.
